# Axon-Cars-Sales

Problem Statement:

A small company Axon, which is a retailer selling classic cars, is facing issues in managing and analysing their sales data. The sales team is struggling to make sense of the data and they do not have a centralized system to manage and analyze the data. The management is unable to get accurate and up-to-date sales reports, which is affecting the decision-making process.

To address this issue, the company has decided to implement a Business Intelligence (BI) tool that can help them manage and analyze their sales data effectively.
